### Problem

Hi! I recently bought the latest generation of **Amazon Kindle Paperwhite**.
Overall, it was a great purchase, but I encountered an annoying issue when connecting to my Wi-Fi. Whenever I entered the password, Kindle would show “Incorrect password."
I have two Wi-Fi networks operating on frequencies 2.4GHz and 5GHz, and the problem occurred with both.
I was 100% sure my password was correct, so I tried pairing my Kindle via Bluetooth using my smartphone. However, the Kindle app didn’t allow me to proceed—the `Next` button stayed inactive when I entered my password. Strangely, the button became active when I typed a shorter or longer password.

What I tried to fix that problem:
- Factory reset the Kindle and my router (and restart!).
- I shared my mobile internet and installed the latest firmware.
- Googling a lot about the problem. Suggestions from users don't help and refer to common steps like checking your password or rebooting the router.

Nothing worked for me.

### Solution

Here’s the solution that worked for me:

1. Go to `All Settings` → `Wi-Fi & Bluetooth` → `Wi-Fi Networks`.
2. Scroll down and select `Other...`.
3. Manually enter your network name (SSID) and password.
4. Here’s an important tip: You can set the security type manually. If the connection fails, try changing it to match your network’s settings.
5. In my case, it was `WPA2`.

After that, my Kindle was successfully connected!

### Thoughts

This behavior of the Kindle is completely weird to me: even Chinese "smart" lamps that cost 4 dollars connect to Wi-Fi without any issues. On the other hand, a company with unbelievable resources and income couldn't fix that problem. I found a lot of topics with the same problem from 2020.
Solving that problem took at least 4 hours for me, and it's not good for a product that cost almost 200 dollars (signature edition).
I hope that the post helps you to fix the problem.
